<P>Every object that is created has an associated identifier or ID that is used to refer to the object within the nSIGHTS user interface.  The ID is always located in the upper left hand corner of the object property window.  All objects have a default ID, usually the name of the object, although some objects automatically change the default based on object properties.</P>

<P>You should usually modify the object name so that a) it is unique, and b) it reflects your usage of the object.  A unique object name is important to distinguish object output, while a relevant object name makes it easier to understand complex visualizations containing many objects.</P>
