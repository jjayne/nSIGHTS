<P>Perturbation analysis consists of executing a model run in nPre with many simulations; the initial estimates of fitting parameters for each simulation are randomly perturbed (i.e. initial estimate is slightly increased or decreased) and the model re-optimizes the fitting parameters from these perturbed estimates.  If each perturbation simulation results in a fitting parameter value close to the initial estimate, the problem solution is unique and well-constrained.</P>

<P>In this tutorial, it will be demonstrated how to conduct a perturbation model run, and to create three useful plots for analyzing perturbation results: a <A HREF="To create a histogram plot.htm">histogram</A>, <A HREF="To create an XY scatter plot.htm">XY scatter plot</A> and <A HREF="To create an XYZ scatter plot.htm">XYZ scatter plot</A>. As well, it will be shown how to <A HREF="Viewing Correlation Coefficients.htm">view the correlation coefficients</A> in a list page window.</P>

<P>It should be noted that the execution of the model for this example will take considerably more time than the simple optimization run (e.g. approximately 20 minutes on a 1GHz dual-processor Pentium III equipped with 2GB of RAM).  </P>
