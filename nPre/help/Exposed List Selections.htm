<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Exposed List Selections</B></FONT></P>

<P>There are two types of exposed list selections: an animation type control and a selector type control. An example exposed list selection is shown below.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="ExposedListControl.jpg"></P>
<P>This animation type control was created by exposing the <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Index Selection Value Source</B></FONT> selection property of an <B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Extract XY from XY Results</B></FONT> object. The title of the control is constructed from the object ID and the name of the exposed property.</P>

<P>The animation type exposed list control has the following capabilities:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Changing the selection with the mouse has the same effect as making the change on the unexposed control on the property window AND pressing <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Apply</B></FONT>.  </LI>
<LI>The four direction push buttons at the bottom assist in navigating the list:  <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">&gt;</B></FONT> increments the selection, <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">&lt;</B></FONT>  decrements the selection, <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">|&lt;- </B></FONT>goes to the first selection in the list, and <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">-&gt;| </B></FONT>goes to the end of the list.  </LI>
<LI>The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Animate</B></FONT> button, when pressed, resets the selection to the start of the list, and then goes through each selection in order.  While animating, the text in the button changes to <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Stop</B></FONT>. </LI>
</UL>

<P>An example exposed list selection is shown below.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="ExposedListControlSelectorType.jpg"></P>
<P>This selector type control was created by exposing the <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Index Selection Value Source</B></FONT> selection property of an <B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Extract Optimizer Results Table</B></FONT> object. The title of the control is constructed from the object ID and the name of the exposed property.</P>

<P>The selector type exposed list control has the following capabilities:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Changing the selection with the mouse has the same effect as making the change on the unexposed control on the property window. The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Apply</B></FONT> button must be selected to apply the changes.  </LI>
<LI>The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">None</B></FONT> button removes the selection for all items in the list. </LI>
<LI>The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">All</B></FONT> button selects all items in the list.</LI>
