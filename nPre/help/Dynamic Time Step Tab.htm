<P>The time step for each sequence is discretized in the <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Sequences</B></FONT> tab, specifically within the </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Sequence Set-up Dialog</B></FONT>.  However, the time step may be automatically adjusted as a function of the pressure change in the well for history, pulse and slug sequences, or the flow rate change in the formation for flow sequences.  </P>

<P>The </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Dynamic Time Step</B></FONT> tab contains the controls for the automatic adjustment of the time step.  Based on maximum and minimum values, the time step is decreased if the pressure or flow change is greater than the specified maximum change, and correspondingly, the time step is increased if the pressure or flow change is less than the specified minimum change.  </P>

<P>The </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#800050">Max # of TS in dynamic sequence</B></FONT> dialog prompt controls the maximum number of time steps that will occur in any one dynamic sequence.  The maximum number of time steps is used for memory allocation only and should not be changed unless run-time errors occur.</P>
