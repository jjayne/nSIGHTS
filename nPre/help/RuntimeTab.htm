<P>The <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Runtime</B></FONT> object tree allows the user to create plots to monitor the real-time progress of the model and write simulation output. </P>

<P>Simulated data sets can be created before the simulation has been conducted.  Error messages will appear on the message line, for example &quot;XY data set is empty&quot;.  As the simulation is being conducted, the data sets are automatically updated.</P>

<P>A plot window is not automatically updated during the simulation.  Addition of an object that forces the plot to update regularly must be used, such as a <B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Data Label</B></FONT> object with the last fit value as input.</P>
