<P>nSIGHTS (n-dimensional Statistical Inverse Graphical Hydraulic Test Simulator) is a comprehensive well test analysis software package.  It provides a user-interface, a well test analysis model and many tools to analyze both field and simulated data.  The well test analysis model simulates a single-phase, one-dimensional, radial/non-radial flow regime, with a borehole at the center of the modeled flow system. </P>

<P>The nSIGHTS system consists of two independent applications: nPre and nPost.  The two applications differ in function, but are similar in their interface.  nPre assists the user in model set-up, data pre-processing, running of the model and diagnostics of the simulation.  nPost post-processes results calculated in nPre and stored in post-processing files.</P>

<P>This on-line manual intends to guide the user in the use of nPost nSIGHTS software; it does not provide a guide to the well test analysis model or to well test analysis. </P>

<P>The first section, <B>Using nSIGHTS</B>, provides an <A HREF="UsingnSIGHTSOverview.htm">overview</A> of the basic steps in working with nSIGHTS, examines some of the <A HREF="Basic Concepts.htm">basic concepts</A> in nSIGHTS as well as to describe the <A HREF="User Interface nPost.htm">user interface</A> and <A HREF="Program Settings.htm">program settings</A>.</P>
