<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Plot Object Visibility</B></FONT></P>

<P>Objects are drawn on the plot in the order that they are created (the order that initially appears in the object tree).  If objects are reorganized in the object tree by dragging and dropping, the plot order can be refreshed by selecting the Refresh button in the plot window.</P>

<P>On a 2D plot, any object plotted before and in the same location as an object that produces a solid color fill, such as <B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Color Block</B></FONT> or <B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Grid Color Fill</B></FONT>, will be visually obliterated by the solid color fill.  For example, if a contour object (<B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Grid Contour</B></FONT> object) is located above a fit surface object (<B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Grid Color Block</B></FONT> object), the contours will be hidden by the solid color fill on the plot.  If the fit surface object is located above the contours, both objects will be visible on the plot.</P>

<P>For 2D plots, plot object visibility is also controlled with <B><I><FONT FACE="RomanS" COLOR="#ff0000">Plot Layers</B></I></FONT>.  Every data display and selection/active object in a 2D plot is assigned to a layer from 0 to 7.  Objects are plotted by ascending layer index (i.e. all layer 0 objects are plotted, followed by layer 1, followed by layer 2, etc.).  Within a layer, objects are plotted in order of definition, except if 2D anti-aliasing is effective (see <A HREF="OpenGL Properties.htm">OpenGL Properties</A>).  In this case, solid objects are plotted first, followed by lines.</P>

<P>Annotation plot objects do not have a layer assignment.  Conceptually, all annotation objects are viewed as existing on layer 8. They are the last objects plotted, and they are plotted in order of definition on each page.</P>

<P>For a 3D plot, object visibility is governed by geometry.  An exception occurs when two objects are plotted in the same place.  In this case, the last object plotted will be visible.  Another exception occurs when lines are plotted at the edges of, or over, polygons.  Because of imprecisions in the OpenGL renderer, the lines may appear stitched, with intermittent visibility.  These stitched lines can be rectified through the use of a polygon offset (<B><FONT COLOR="#800050">PolyOff</B></FONT> in the <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Plot Settings</B></FONT> box).  </P>

<P><IMG SRC="PolyOff.jpg"></P>

<P>This field is only available for 3D plot objects that plot polygons.  It slightly modifies the position of the polygon, allowing the user to ensure that lines are visible.  The effect of specific values depends upon the version of OpenGL (1.0 or 1.1) and the depth in bits of the Z buffer. Generally, if a polygon offset is required, a <B><FONT COLOR="#800050">PolyOff</B></FONT> value of 1.0 is acceptable.</P>

<P>There are special concerns for plot object visibility when producing Postscript output. These are described in <A HREF="Postscript Output.htm">Postscript Output</A>.</P>
