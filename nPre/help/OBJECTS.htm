<P>An object has a defined function related to data input/output, data manipulation, or plot construction.  A fundamental premise in nSIGHTS is that objects can be combined in many flexible ways to produce a near-infinite variety of data processing procedures and visualizations.  </P>

<P>Each page type has associated objects, specifically data objects, plot objects, list objects and output objects.  In addition, there is a system object, described in <A HREF="Global Objects.htm">System Objects</A>.  However, all objects have similar characteristics and controls, which are described in this section.  </P>
