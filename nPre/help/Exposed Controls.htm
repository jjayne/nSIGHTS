<P>One drawback to the object property window of the nSIGHTS user-interface (UI) is that it is difficult to rapidly change properties of a plotted object or two objects. For example, to repeatedly change the selected run and/or simulation of an extract object (e.g. <B><FONT FACE="Technical" COLOR="#008000">Extract XY from XY Results</B></FONT> object) and view the change in a plot requires the following procedure:</P>

<P>1)  select the run and/or simulation.</P>
<P>2)  press <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Apply</P></B></FONT>
<P>3) select the plot window to view results</P>
<P>4) select the Main Menu</P>
<P>5) select the extract object in the object tree</P>
<P>6)  change the run and/or simulation selection</P>
<P>7)  press <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Apply</P></B></FONT>
<P>8)  re-select the plot window to view results.</P>
<P>9)  repeat steps 4 to 8</P>

<P>nSIGHTS offers a capability called <B><I><FONT FACE="RomanS" COLOR="#ff0000">exposed controls</B></I></FONT> to resolve this problem.  An exposed control is a UI element which has been disabled on the object property window and has been re-created in its own small top-level window.  Within this top-level window are the control and additional UI elements to support other capabilities.  Exposed controls are actuated by selecting the <B><FONT COLOR="#800050">Expose</B></FONT> toggle on selected UI components.  Exposed controls are bundled with Master/Slave capabilities.  Note that only master controls can be exposed.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The element remains exposed after the property pane has been changed to a different object. The exposed control will be available until it is disabled (<B><FONT COLOR="#800050">Expose</B></FONT> toggle switched off), or the object is deleted.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There are currently two types of exposed controls: <A HREF="Exposed List Selections.htm">list selections</A> and <A HREF="Exposed Reals.htm">real values</A>.  </P>
