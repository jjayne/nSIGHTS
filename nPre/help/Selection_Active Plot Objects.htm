<P>Selection/active plot objects use the mouse to select, enter and/or modify data.  They are only available for 2D plots.  </P>

<P>In order to select, enter or modify data on a 2D plot using a selection/active plot object, the cursor must be in <B><I><FONT FACE="RomanS" COLOR="#ff0000">selection mode</B></I></FONT> and the selection/active object must be in active mode. Selection mode is enabled if the selection button <IMG SRC="PlotSelectModeButton.jpg"> in the 2D plot window toolbar is selected.  Active mode for a selection/active object is enabled by a check marked <B><FONT COLOR="#800050">Active</B></FONT> toggle in the object’s <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">Plot Settings</B></FONT> frame. </P>

<P>Once in selection mode, the pop-up menu for the 2D plot window is modified to an object specific pop-up menu. </P>

<P>The following table summarizes the function of the selection/active plot objects available.  In addition, a description of the object pop-up window and the required object input is provided.  If the object input is none, the input required for the object is based on mouse actions in the 2D plot window.</P>
