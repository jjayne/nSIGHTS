<P>nSIGHTS supports two basic types of plots: a 2D XY Plot and a 3D XYZ Plot.  </P>

<P>When a plot page is created through the page menu, several things happen:   </P>
<DIR>
<P>1)  A new page is created in the object tree.</P>
<P>2)  Default objects are added to the new page tree.</P>
<P>3)  A new top level window is created containing the basic plot.   At creation the plot will contain only axes and axes increment labels.  </P>
</DIR>

<P>As well, nSIGHTs supports composite plots.  A composite plot page contains 2D XY and/or 3D XYZ  plots within a single plot page. </P>

<P>This section will provide a basic overview of nSIGHTS's plotting capabilities.  Plot objects and their function will be discussed, as well as user interaction with plots, creation of composite plots and plot output.</P>
