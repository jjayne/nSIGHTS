<P>The method used to animate output is to create successive bitmap frames of an animation in nSIGHTS (see <A HREF="Bitmap Output.htm">Bitmap Output</A>) and then to convert the frames to an animation using a third party tool.  For example, to create a five frame animation called test.avi, the third party tool requires a sequence of files as follows: test0000.tga, test0001.tga, test0002.tga, test0003.tga, test0004.tga.</P>

<P>Currently, the best available tool is a shareware product called VideoMach.  VideoMach reads sequences of TGA files and produces AVI animations.   The shareware product is available at: <B>http://www.gromada.com</B>. </P>

<P>In general, lossless AVI coder/decoders (codecs) such as Microsoft Video 1 (with 100% compression quality and temporal quality ratio of 1.0) produce the best quality animations, albeit with larger output file sizes.   Lossy compressors, such as MPEG, frequently leave unattractive visual artifacts.   The most effective lossless animation format (in terms of smallest file sizes) is the proprietary HAV format created by VM.  However, it is not supported for use in other third-party tools such as Director or Power Point and requires use of the freeware HAV file player (also available from www.gromada.com). The HAV file play is superior to the Windows Media player in many ways.</P>
