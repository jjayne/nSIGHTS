nSIGHTS
=======

This repository is the official open source version of nSIGHTS, the MS-Windows (32- and 64-bit) n-dimensional Statistical Inverse Graphical Hydraulic Test Simulator.

nSIGHTS (n-dimensional Statistical Inverse Graphical Hydraulic Test Simulator) is a comprehensive well test analysis software package. It provides a user-interface, a well test analysis model and many tools to analyze both field and simulated data. The well test analysis model simulates a single-phase, one-dimensional, radial/non-radial flow regime, with a borehole at the center of the modeled flow system. 

The nSIGHTS system consists of two independent MS-Windows GUI applications: nPre and nPost. The two applications differ in function, but are similar in their interface. nPre assists the user in model set-up, data pre-processing, running of the model and diagnostics of the simulation. nPost post-processes results calculated in nPre and stored in post-processing files.

The "Setup_nSIGHTS" and "Setup_nSIGHTS_64" directories contain Windows installers (.msi files) for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of nSIGHTS.  If you are interested in downloading and using nSIGHTS, but are not interested in using git to clone the repository, you can download the repository as a .zip file (button along right of site), which includes the windows installer files.

nSIGHTS includes a large amount of documentation in Windows Help format (available from the program at run time), and as design documents in the "documents" folder.
