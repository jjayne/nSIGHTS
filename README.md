=======

Open source version of nSIGHTS, the n-dimensional Statistical Inverse Graphical Hydraulic Test Simulator

nSIGHTS (n-dimensional Statistical Inverse Graphical Hydraulic Test Simulator) is a comprehensive well test analysis software package. It provides a user-interface, a well test analysis model and many tools to analyze both field and simulated data. The well test analysis model simulates a single-phase, one-dimensional, radial/non-radial flow regime, with a borehole at the center of the modeled flow system. 

The nSIGHTS system consists of two independent applications: nPre and nPost. The two applications differ in function, but are similar in their interface. nPre assists the user in model set-up, data pre-processing, running of the model and diagnostics of the simulation. nPost post-processes results calculated in nPre and stored in post-processing files.
